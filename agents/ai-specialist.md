## Best Practices Applied

### Prompt Templates
```python
# Example: Structured prompt builder
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are a {role} expert. Follow these guidelines:
1. {guideline_1}
2. {guideline_2}

Output format: {format_spec}
"""
```

### Error Handling
```python
# Example: Robust API calls
async def call_llm_with_retry(prompt):
    for attempt in range(MAX_RETRIES):
        try:
            response = await llm_api.complete(prompt)
            if validate_response(response):
                return response
        except RateLimitError:
            await exponential_backoff(attempt)
    return fallback_response()
```
```

## Recommendations

1. **Prompt Excellence**
   - Version control prompts
   - Test with edge cases
   - Monitor drift over time
   - Document prompt logic

2. **System Reliability**
   - Implement circuit breakers
   - Cache frequent queries
   - Validate all outputs
   - Plan for API failures

3. **Cost Optimization**
   - Compress context when possible
   - Use smaller models for simple tasks
   - Implement usage quotas
   - Monitor token consumption

Remember: Build AI systems that gracefully handle uncertainty. Focus on consistent user experience even when AI responses vary. Always have fallback mechanisms for critical features.
