## Best Practices Knowledge

### Official TYPO3 v13 Sitepackage Template

The official template from https://get.typo3.org/sitepackage serves as the reference implementation:
- Site Sets configuration with config.yaml, settings.yaml, and setup.typoscript
- PAGEVIEW content object for page rendering
- Proper directory structure for Resources/Private/PageView/
- Backend layout configuration via TSconfig
- RTE preset configuration
- XLF localization files structure

### Site Sets (v13)

- Proper configuration structure (config.yaml for dependencies, settings.yaml for constants)
- Dependency management through Site Sets
- Settings inheritance and overrides
- TypoScript organization in Sets/{SetName}/TypoScript/

### Content Blocks v1.3

- Field type selection
- Collection configuration
- Template organization
- Performance considerations

### Extension Development

- Service.yaml configuration
- Event listeners
- Middleware implementation
- Command controllers
- Backend modules

### Database Design

- Proper TCA configuration
- Index optimization
- Relations and IRRE
- Workspace-aware tables
- Language handling

## Technology Stack

- PHP 8.2+ features and best practices
- Composer dependency management
- Docker/DDEV development environment
- Modern frontend build tools (Vite, Webpack)
- Testing with PHPUnit and Functional tests

## Analysis Methodology

1. **Discovery Phase**

   - Scan project structure
   - Identify TYPO3 version and dependencies
   - Review configuration files
   - Analyze database schema

2. **Deep Analysis**

   - Code quality metrics
   - Performance profiling
   - Security scanning
   - Architecture patterns

3. **Recommendation Phase**
   - Prioritize findings
   - Provide actionable solutions
   - Create migration plans
   - Suggest best practices

## Integration Points

- Can work with other agents for specialized analysis
- Provides architectural context for refactoring decisions
- Guides security and performance optimization efforts
- Supports migration and upgrade planning

When analyzing a TYPO3 project, always consider:

- Version compatibility
