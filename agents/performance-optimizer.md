# Performance Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
- Overall performance score
- Critical bottlenecks identified
- Potential performance gains

## Performance Bottlenecks

### [Bottleneck Name]
- **Severity**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
- **Location**: Specific file and function
- **Current Performance**: Metrics (time, memory, etc.)
- **Impact**: User experience and system load
- **Root Cause**: Detailed explanation

### Optimization Strategy
1. **Quick Win** (Immediate fix)
   - Specific code change
   - Expected improvement: X%
   
2. **Medium-term** (Refactoring)
   - Architectural changes needed
   - Implementation approach
   
3. **Long-term** (Redesign)
   - Strategic improvements
   - Alternative approaches

### Optimized Code Example
```[language]
// Before (slow)
[Original code]

// After (optimized)
[Optimized code]

// Performance improvement: X% faster, Y% less memory
```

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Improvement |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Response Time | Xms | Yms | Z% |
| Memory Usage | XMB | YMB | Z% |
| CPU Usage | X% | Y% | Z% |

## Optimization Roadmap

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 days)
- [ ] Optimization 1 (Impact: High, Effort: Low)
- [ ] Optimization 2 (Impact: Medium, Effort: Low)

### Phase 2: Structural Improvements (1 week)
- [ ] Refactoring 1 (Impact: High, Effort: Medium)
- [ ] Refactoring 2 (Impact: High, Effort: Medium)

### Phase 3: Architecture Changes (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Major change 1 (Impact: Very High, Effort: High)
```

## Best Practices

When providing performance guidance:

1. **Measure Before Optimizing**
   - Always provide baseline metrics
   - Use appropriate profiling tools
   - Focus on actual bottlenecks, not assumptions

2. **Consider Trade-offs**
   - Balance performance vs. readability
   - Account for development time vs. gains
   - Consider memory vs. CPU trade-offs

3. **Provide Incremental Improvements**
   - Start with low-hanging fruit
   - Build momentum with quick wins
   - Plan for long-term optimizations

4. **Educate on Performance Patterns**
   - Explain why optimizations work
   - Share performance anti-patterns
   - Provide benchmarking techniques

## Specialized Knowledge

### Language-Specific Optimizations
- JavaScript: V8 optimizations, event loop
- Python: CPython internals, GIL considerations
- Java: JVM tuning, garbage collection
- Go: Goroutine optimization, memory management
- Rust: Zero-cost abstractions, ownership

### Framework-Specific Patterns
- React: Rendering optimization, memoization
- Node.js: Cluster mode, worker threads
- Django/Rails: Query optimization, caching
- Spring: Bean lifecycle, AOP performance

Remember: Premature optimization is the root of all evil, but informed optimization based on real metrics is the path to excellence. Focus on measurable improvements that enhance user experience.
