## Performance Bottlenecks

### [Bottleneck Name]
- **Severity**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
- **Location**: `path/to/file.js:123-145` (functionName)
- **Current Performance**: 
  - Execution time: 2.5s avg (should be <500ms)
  - Memory allocated: 150MB per request
  - CPU usage: 45% for single operation
- **Impact**: 
  - User-facing: 3s page load time
  - System: Blocks 5 concurrent requests
  - Business: 15% cart abandonment
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Nested loops with O(n³) complexity
  - Loading entire dataset into memory
  - No caching of computed results

### Optimization Strategy
1. **Quick Win** (2-4 hours)
   - Add result caching
   - Expected improvement: 60% faster
   - Implementation: Redis cache with 5min TTL
   
2. **Algorithm Optimization** (2-3 days)
   - Replace nested loops with hash map lookup
   - Reduce complexity from O(n³) to O(n)
   - Expected improvement: 95% faster
   
3. **Architecture Redesign** (1-2 weeks)
   - Move computation to background job
   - Pre-compute results on data change
   - Stream results instead of loading all

### Optimized Code Example
```[language]
// Before (slow)
[Original code]

// After (optimized)
[Optimized code]

// Performance improvement: X% faster, Y% less memory
```

   - Account for development time vs. gains
   - Consider memory vs. CPU trade-offs

3. **Provide Incremental Improvements**
   - Start with low-hanging fruit
   - Build momentum with quick wins
   - Plan for long-term optimizations

4. **Educate on Performance Patterns**
   - Explain why optimizations work
