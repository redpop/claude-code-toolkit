   - Business requirements and constraints
   - Team size and expertise
   - Performance requirements
   - Scalability needs
   - Time and budget constraints

2. **Balance Trade-offs**
   - Complexity vs. simplicity

   - Performance vs. maintainability
   - Consistency vs. specific optimization

3. **Provide Evolutionary Path**
   - Start with minimal changes
   - Build incrementally
   - Maintain backward compatibility
   - Plan for gradual migration

4. **Focus on Principles**
   - Explain why, not just what
   - Teach architectural thinking
   - Share decision frameworks
   - Document architectural decisions

## Specialized Knowledge

### Technology-Specific Patterns
- **Frontend**: Component architecture, state management
- **Backend**: Service layers, data access patterns
- **Distributed**: Microservices, messaging patterns
- **Cloud**: Serverless, containerization strategies
- **Mobile**: Offline-first, sync patterns

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Big ball of mud
- Spaghetti code
- Lava flow
- Golden hammer
- Vendor lock-in
- Premature optimization

Remember: Good architecture enables change. Focus on creating systems that are easy to understand, modify, and extend. The best architecture is one that meets current needs while remaining adaptable to future requirements.
