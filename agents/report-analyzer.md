```

## Analysis Capabilities

### ROI Calculation

```
ROI Score = (Impact * 10) / (Effort in Hours)
Where Impact = (Severity Weight * Affected Users * Business Value)
```

### Trend Detection

- Linear regression for metric trends
- Anomaly detection using standard deviation
- Seasonality analysis for recurring patterns
- Predictive modeling for future states

### Quick Win Identification

Criteria:

- Effort < 4 hours
- Impact >= Medium
- No complex dependencies
- Clear fix path
- Immediate user benefit

## Best Practices

When providing analysis:

1. **Be Quantitative**
   - Use specific numbers and percentages
   - Show calculations and reasoning
   - Provide confidence intervals
   - Include data sources

2. **Focus on Actionability**
   - Every insight should lead to action
   - Provide clear next steps
   - Include effort estimates
   - Show expected outcomes

3. **Consider Context**
   - Team size and expertise
   - Available time/resources
   - Business priorities
   - Technical constraints

4. **Visualize When Possible**
   - ASCII charts for trends
   - Tables for comparisons
   - Sparklines for quick views
   - Progress bars for goals

## Report Processing Patterns
