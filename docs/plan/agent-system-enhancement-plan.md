# Agent System Enhancement Plan

## Executive Summary

Based on insights from Claude Log's agent engineering articles, this plan outlines comprehensive improvements to the Claude Code Toolkit's agent system. The enhancements focus on parallel processing, personality configuration, output customization, and workflow automation.

## 1. Split-Role Sub-Agents Pattern

### Concept

Enable multiple agents with different perspectives to analyze the same problem simultaneously, providing comprehensive multi-faceted insights.

### Implementation Details

#### 1.1 Architecture

```yaml
split_role_config:
  perspectives:
    - security_expert: "Focus on vulnerabilities and security best practices"
    - senior_engineer: "Focus on architecture and maintainability"
    - performance_analyst: "Focus on optimization opportunities"
    - creative_innovator: "Focus on alternative approaches"
```

#### 1.2 New Agent Files

- `agents/split-role-analyzer.md` - Orchestrates multi-perspective analysis
- `agents/perspectives/security-perspective.md`
- `agents/perspectives/senior-perspective.md`
- `agents/perspectives/performance-perspective.md`
- `agents/perspectives/creative-perspective.md`

#### 1.3 Invocation Pattern

```bash
# Command integration
/prefix:analyze . --split-role --perspectives="security,senior,performance"

# Task Tool integration
Task tool with subagent_type="split-role-analyzer"
prompt: "Analyze authentication system from multiple perspectives"
```

### Benefits

- Comprehensive analysis coverage
- Parallel processing efficiency
- Reduced blind spots
- Enhanced decision-making data

## 2. Orchestrator Pattern

### Concept

Central coordination agent that decomposes complex tasks, assigns to specialized agents, and synthesizes results.

### Implementation Details

#### 2.1 Core Orchestrator Agent

```yaml
name: orchestrator
description: Master coordinator for complex multi-agent workflows
capabilities:
  - task_decomposition
  - agent_selection
  - dependency_management
  - result_synthesis
```

#### 2.2 Workflow Management

```markdown
## Orchestration Flow
1. Receive complex task
2. Decompose into subtasks
3. Identify dependencies
4. Assign to specialized agents
5. Monitor progress
6. Synthesize results
7. Deliver unified output
```

#### 2.3 Integration Points

- New command: `/prefix:orchestrate`
- Enhanced Task Tool support
- Progress tracking via TodoWrite
- Result aggregation patterns

### Use Cases

- Large refactoring projects
- Full-stack feature implementation
- System-wide security audits
- Performance optimization campaigns

## 3. Personality Traits System

### Concept

Configure agent personalities to match task requirements, improving communication and effectiveness.

### Implementation Details

#### 3.1 Personality Categories

Based on Claude Log insights:

```yaml
personalities:
  debugging:
    traits: ["playful", "investigative", "curious"]
    tone: "Let's hunt down this bug together!"

  code_review:
    traits: ["meticulous", "sharp-eyed", "constructive"]
    tone: "I noticed a few opportunities for improvement..."

  performance:
    traits: ["high-energy", "focused", "analytical"]
    tone: "Time to make this code fly!"

  development:
    traits: ["gentle", "methodical", "patient"]
    tone: "Let's build this step by step..."

  documentation:
    traits: ["articulate", "loving", "thorough"]
    tone: "Let me help you tell this code's story..."

  operations:
    traits: ["cool", "reliable", "systematic"]
    tone: "Deploying with confidence and precision."
```

#### 3.2 Agent Template Enhancement

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: Agent description
personality:
  type: debugging  # or code_review, performance, etc.
  custom_traits: []  # optional overrides
---
```

#### 3.3 Dynamic Personality Selection

```bash
# Command-line personality override
/prefix:debug . --personality="playful"

# Context-aware selection
if task_type == "bug_fix":
    use_personality("debugging")
elif task_type == "optimization":
    use_personality("performance")
```

## 4. Output Style System

### Concept

Customizable output formats for different learning styles and use cases.

### Implementation Details

#### 4.1 Style Definitions

Create `output-styles/` directory:

```markdown
output-styles/
├── default.md      # Standard engineering style
├── explanatory.md  # Educational with detailed explanations
├── learning.md     # Collaborative learning mode
├── concise.md      # Minimal, action-focused
├── verbose.md      # Comprehensive with examples
└── custom/         # User-defined styles
```

#### 4.2 Style Configuration

```yaml
output_style:
  name: explanatory
  features:
    - code_comments: detailed
    - examples: multiple
    - reasoning: step_by_step
    - terminology: explained
```

#### 4.3 Integration

```bash
# Command integration
/prefix:analyze . --output-style="explanatory"

# Per-agent default styles
agent_config:
  default_style: learning
```

## 5. Enhanced Bash Script Integration

### Concept

Leverage bash scripts for automation, hooks, and workflow optimization.

### Implementation Details

#### 5.1 Agent Lifecycle Hooks

```bash
hooks/
├── pre-agent.sh     # Before agent execution
├── post-agent.sh    # After agent completion
├── on-error.sh      # Error handling
└── on-success.sh    # Success notifications
```

#### 5.2 Parallel Processing Scripts

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# parallel-agents.sh
parallel_analyze() {
    local agents=("$@")
    for agent in "${agents[@]}"; do
        invoke_agent "$agent" &
    done
    wait
    aggregate_results
}
```

#### 5.3 Notification System

```bash
# Terminal bell on completion
agent_complete() {
    echo -e "\a"  # Terminal bell
    notify-send "Agent Complete" "$1 finished analysis"
}
```
