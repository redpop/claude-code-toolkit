# Orchestrator Pattern Design Document

## Overview

The Orchestrator Pattern provides a central coordination agent that decomposes complex tasks, assigns work to specialized agents, manages dependencies, and synthesizes results into unified outputs. This enables handling of sophisticated multi-step workflows that would be difficult for individual agents.

## Core Concept

### Traditional Linear Workflow

```
User Request → Single Agent → Single Solution → Limited Scope
```

### Orchestrator-Managed Workflow

```
User Request → Orchestrator → Task Decomposition → Agent Assignment → Result Synthesis
                           ├─ Task A → Agent 1
                           ├─ Task B → Agent 2
                           ├─ Task C → Agent 3
                           └─ Task D → Agent 4
```

## Architecture Design

### 3. Task Decomposition Framework

#### Task Analysis Matrix

```yaml
task_analysis:
  complexity_assessment:
    simple: "Single agent can handle in one session"
    moderate: "2-3 agents with minimal dependencies"
    complex: "4+ agents with significant interdependencies"
    enterprise: "Cross-system changes requiring coordinated effort"

  domain_identification:
    technical: ["security", "performance", "architecture"]
    functional: ["frontend", "backend", "database"]
    operational: ["deployment", "monitoring", "testing"]

  dependency_mapping:
    sequential: "Task B requires completion of Task A"
    parallel: "Tasks can run simultaneously"
    conditional: "Task execution depends on runtime decisions"
    blocking: "Task must complete before others can proceed"
```

description: "Large-scale code refactoring with comprehensive analysis"

phases:
  analysis:
    tasks:
      - codebase_assessment: "code-understanding-specialist"
      - architecture_analysis: "code-architect"
      - dependency_mapping: "codebase-research-specialist"

  planning:
    tasks:
      - refactoring_strategy: "refactoring-expert"
      - risk_assessment: "security-specialist"
      - testing_strategy: "test-engineer"

      - integration_testing: "test-engineer"
      - documentation_update: "documentation-specialist"
      - deployment_planning: "deployment-specialist"

dependencies:
  - analysis → planning
  - planning → implementation
  - implementation → validation

  - analysis.*
  - planning.refactoring_strategy + planning.risk_assessment

      - system_integration: "code-architect"
      - testing_suite: "test-engineer"
      - deployment_setup: "deployment-specialist"

dependencies:
  - requirements → frontend
  - requirements → backend
  - frontend + backend → integration
```

### 3. Progress Tracking Integration

#### TodoWrite Integration

```markdown
## Progress Tracking Pattern

The orchestrator uses TodoWrite tool to maintain real-time visibility:

### Initial Planning Phase
- Create high-level tasks in TodoWrite
- Mark complex tasks as "pending"
- Set initial task as "in_progress"

### Execution Phase
- Update task status as agents complete work
- Add new subtasks as they're discovered
- Track dependencies and blockers

### Completion Phase
- Mark all tasks as "completed"
- Add final synthesis task
- Provide comprehensive status report
```

#### Status Reporting Format

```markdown
## Orchestration Status Report

### Overall Progress: [X/Y Tasks Complete] ([percentage]%)

### Current Phase: [Phase Name]
**Active Tasks:**
- [Task 1] - [Agent] - [Status]
- [Task 2] - [Agent] - [Status]

**Completed Tasks:**
- ✅ [Task A] - Completed by [Agent]
- ✅ [Task B] - Completed by [Agent]

**Pending Tasks:**
- ⏳ [Task C] - Waiting for [Dependency]
- ⏳ [Task D] - Scheduled next

### Next Actions:
1. [Immediate next step]
2. [Following action]
3. [Subsequent task]
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### 1. Command Integration

#### Enhanced Commands with Orchestration

```bash
# Existing commands gain orchestration capabilities
/prefix:understand . --orchestrated
/prefix:improve . --orchestrated --comprehensive
/prefix:create feature --orchestrated --full-stack
/prefix:secure . --orchestrated --deep-audit
/prefix:ship . --orchestrated --complete-pipeline
```

#### New Orchestration Commands

```bash
# Dedicated orchestration command
/prefix:orchestrate [request] [options]

# Workflow-specific commands
/prefix:refactor . --orchestrated
/prefix:feature [description] --orchestrated
/prefix:audit . --orchestrated --comprehensive
```

### 2. Agent Ecosystem Integration

#### Agent Selection Logic

```python
# Pseudo-code for agent selection
def select_agent(task_type, requirements):
    agent_mapping = {
        'security_analysis': 'security-specialist',
        'performance_optimization': 'performance-optimizer',
        'architecture_review': 'code-architect',
        'frontend_development': 'frontend-specialist',
        'testing_strategy': 'test-engineer',
        'documentation': 'documentation-specialist'
    }

    # Consider agent availability and specialization
    primary_agent = agent_mapping.get(task_type)

    # Handle complex tasks requiring multiple agents
    if requirements.get('comprehensive'):
        return select_multiple_agents(task_type, requirements)

    return primary_agent
```

#### Result Aggregation Patterns

```markdown
## Result Synthesis Patterns

### 1. Consensus Building
- Identify areas where multiple agents agree
- Highlight consensus recommendations as high-confidence

### 2. Conflict Resolution
- Compare conflicting recommendations
- Analyze trade-offs and context
- Provide balanced resolution with rationale

### 3. Gap Analysis
- Identify areas not covered by any agent
- Flag potential blind spots
- Suggest additional analysis if needed

### 4. Priority Ranking
- Combine insights from all agents
- Apply weighting based on impact and effort
- Create actionable priority matrix
```

## Advanced Orchestration Patterns

### 1. Adaptive Orchestration

```markdown
## Dynamic Workflow Adjustment

The orchestrator adapts based on intermediate results:

### Early Findings Impact
- Security vulnerabilities → Add security-focused tasks
- Performance issues → Include optimization agents
- Architecture problems → Engage architectural review

### Resource Optimization
- Agent availability → Adjust task assignment
- Context window constraints → Optimize task granularity
- Time constraints → Prioritize critical paths

### Quality Gates
- Intermediate quality checks → Trigger additional validation
- Dependency failures → Implement fallback strategies
- Scope changes → Re-evaluate task breakdown
```

### 2. Learning and Optimization

```markdown
## Orchestration Learning

Track orchestration effectiveness for continuous improvement:

### Success Metrics
- Task completion rates
- Agent utilization efficiency
- Result quality scores
- User satisfaction ratings

### Pattern Recognition
- Identify successful task decomposition patterns
