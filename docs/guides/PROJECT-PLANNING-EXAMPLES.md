## ðŸ”§ Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Analysis-First Planning

```bash
# Always start with understanding before planning
/prefix:understand . --comprehensive-analysis
# Then invoke project-planner based on findings
Use Task tool with subagent_type="project-planner":
"Based on the analysis results, create strategic plan for [specific requirements]"
```

### Pattern 2: Iterative Planning

```bash
# Phase 1 planning
/prefix:understand . --strategic-planning --phase=foundation
# Implement Phase 1
/prefix:create phase1 --implementation
# Re-plan based on learnings
/prefix:understand . --strategic-planning --phase=next --lessons-learned
```

### Pattern 3: Risk-Driven Planning

```bash
# High-risk projects need extensive risk analysis
Use Task tool with subagent_type="project-planner":
