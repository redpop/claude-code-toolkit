```

## Optimization Patterns

### 6-Command Integration Workflows

#### Analysis-First Development

- Start with understanding before making changes
- Use `/prefix:understand . --focus=architecture` then `/prefix:improve . --based-on-analysis`

#### Security-Focused Development

- Regular security validation and improvement
- `/prefix:secure . --comprehensive` followed by `/prefix:improve . --security-focus`

#### Documentation-Driven Development

- Keep documentation synchronized
- `/prefix:understand . --docs-analysis` then `/prefix:create docs --fill-gaps`

#### Quality-First Deployment

- Validate before deployment
- `/prefix:ship . --readiness-check` then `/prefix:improve . --deployment-focus`

### Bottleneck Identification

Common workflow friction points to optimize:

1. **Context Switching**: Reduce tool switching between commands
2. **Manual Processes**: Identify repetitive tasks for optimization
3. **Information Loss**: Preserve insights between command executions
4. **Inefficient Sequences**: Find optimal command ordering
