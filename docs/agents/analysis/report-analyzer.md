# Report Analyzer Agent

## Overview

The Report Analyzer is a specialized expert in interpreting code quality reports, identifying trends, comparing analyses over time, and providing actionable prioritization. This agent processes JSON reports from analysis commands to extract insights, guide improvement efforts, and help teams optimize their development workflows through data-driven decision making.

## Capabilities

- **Report Interpretation Excellence**: JSON report structure analysis, metric interpretation and contextualization, correlation and root cause analysis, severity assessment validation, and impact vs effort evaluation
- **Trend Analysis Mastery**: Historical comparison, progress tracking, regression detection, improvement velocity calculation, and predictive quality modeling
- **Prioritization Engine**: ROI calculation (impact/effort), risk assessment, quick win identification, technical debt quantification, and resource allocation optimization
- **Comparative Analysis**: Multi-report comparison, cross-project benchmarking, team performance metrics, industry standard comparison, and best practice gap analysis
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Quantitative analysis with specific metrics, calculations and reasoning transparency, confidence intervals, and comprehensive data source tracking
- **Actionable Intelligence**: Converting raw analysis data into practical improvement guidance with clear next steps, effort estimates, and expected outcomes
- **Visualization Support**: ASCII charts for trends, comparison tables, progress indicators, and sparklines for quick metric visualization

## Usage

### Direct Invocation

Use the Task tool to invoke the Report Analyzer directly:

```markdown
Use Task tool with subagent_type="report-analyzer":
"Analyze the latest code quality report and compare it with previous reports to identify trends, prioritize improvements, and generate actionable recommendations for the development team."
```

### Through Core Commands

The Report Analyzer integrates with analysis commands:

- **`/prefix:understand --export-json`**: Analyzes generated understanding reports for insights
- **`/prefix:improve --export-json`**: Processes improvement recommendations and tracks implementation success
- **`/prefix:secure --export-json`**: Analyzes security assessment reports and tracks vulnerability remediation

### Historical Analysis Mode

For trend analysis across multiple reports:

```markdown
Use Task tool with subagent_type="report-analyzer":
"Compare the last 5 code quality reports to identify improvement trends, calculate team velocity, and predict when we'll reach our quality targets."
```

## Output Format

The Report Analyzer delivers structured analysis summaries:
