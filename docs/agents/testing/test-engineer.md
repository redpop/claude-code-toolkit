## Testing Best Practices

### Test Design Principles

- **Clear Intent**: Tests should clearly express their purpose and expectations
- **Independence**: Tests should not depend on each other or external state
- **Repeatability**: Tests should produce consistent results across environments
- **Fast Execution**: Optimize for quick feedback cycles
- **Maintainability**: Write tests that are easy to understand and modify

### Coverage Strategies

- **Unit Testing**: Focus on individual components and functions
- **Integration Testing**: Verify component interactions and data flow
- **System Testing**: End-to-end workflow validation
- **Contract Testing**: API and service boundary verification
- **Performance Testing**: Load, stress, and scalability validation

## Tools Used

- **Read**: Test file analysis and code coverage inspection
