# Quick Start Tutorial: Claude Code Toolkit

Welcome to the Claude Code Toolkit! This tutorial will walk you through getting started with this powerful set of tools for code analysis, security auditing, and automated improvements. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be analyzing and improving your codebase automatically! üöÄ

## üéØ NEW: Zero-Friction Workflow

The Claude Code Toolkit now features an automated workflow that takes you from analysis to completed fixes in just 3 commands:

```bash
# 1. Analyze your code
/analyze-deep . --export-json

# 2. Generate fix plan  
/analyze-report reports/*.json --generate-action-plan

# 3. Execute fixes
/execute-action-plan reports/action-plan-*.md
```

That's it! The toolkit handles everything else. For details, see our [Automated Workflow Guide](../guides/AUTOMATED-WORKFLOW.md).

## Prerequisites and Setup Verification

Before we begin, let's ensure you have everything needed to use the Claude Code Toolkit effectively.

### Required Software

1. **Claude Code (claude.ai/code)** - You need access to Claude Code
2. **Git** - For cloning the repository
3. **Bash shell** - For running the installation script (macOS/Linux have this by default)

### Verify Your Environment

Open your terminal and run these commands:

```bash
# Check if git is installed
git --version
# Expected output: git version 2.x.x

# Check your shell
echo $SHELL
# Expected output: /bin/bash or /bin/zsh (both work)

# Check if you have the Claude directory
ls ~/.claude/
# If this doesn't exist yet, that's okay - we'll create it during installation
```

> **üí° Tip:** If you're on Windows, use Git Bash or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for the best experience.

## Installing the Toolkit

Let's install the Claude Code Toolkit step by step.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the toolkit repository to your local machine:

```bash
# Navigate to where you keep your projects
cd ~/projects  # Or wherever you prefer

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-code-toolkit.git

# Enter the directory
cd claude-code-toolkit
```

### Step 2: Run the Installation Script

Now, let's install the toolkit with a custom prefix. The prefix helps you organize commands if you have multiple toolkit installations.

```bash
# Run the installer with a prefix (I'll use 'tk' for toolkit)
./install.sh tk
```

You'll see output like this:

```
üöÄ Claude Code Toolkit Installer
================================

üì¶ Installing with prefix: tk

Creating directories...
‚úÖ Created ~/.claude/commands/tk/
‚úÖ Created ~/.claude/agents/

Copying commands...
‚úÖ Installed 42 commands

Copying agents...
‚úÖ Installed 7 agents

Installation complete! üéâ

Available commands:
  /tk:analyze:deep - Deep code analysis using hybrid Task Tool + Sub-Agent approach
  /tk:analyze:report - Analyze code quality reports with ROI prioritization
  /tk:fix:quick-wins - Automatically implement high-value, low-effort fixes
  ... (more commands listed)
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation

In Claude Code, test that your commands are available:

1. Open Claude Code (claude.ai/code)
2. Type `/tk:` and you should see autocomplete suggestions
3. Try a simple command like `/tk:help` to see available commands

> **üîß Troubleshooting:** If commands don't appear, try refreshing Claude Code or check that the installation path `~/.claude/commands/tk/` contains the command files.

## Option A: Automated Workflow (Recommended)

This is the fastest way to improve your codebase. The toolkit will analyze, prioritize, and fix issues automatically.

### Step 1: Run Deep Analysis

Navigate to your project and run the comprehensive analysis:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd ~/my-project

# Run deep analysis with all export formats
/tk:analysis:analyze-deep . --export-all
```

This will:

- Scan your entire codebase using 10 parallel agents
- Analyze security, performance, architecture, testing, and more
- Generate reports in JSON, Markdown, and HTML formats
- Take about 30-60 seconds depending on project size

**Expected Output:**

```
‚è∫ Phase 1: Quick Scan (10 agents working in parallel)...
‚è∫ Phase 2: Deep Analysis with specialized agents...
‚è∫ Phase 3: Synthesizing results...

‚úÖ Analysis Complete!
üìÅ Generated Reports:
- reports/analyze-deep-20250129-103000.md
- reports/analyze-deep-20250129-103000.json
- reports/analyze-deep-20250129-103000.html

Key Findings:
üî¥ Critical Issues: 3 (Security vulnerabilities)
üü° High Priority: 8 (Quick wins available)
üü¢ Enhancements: 12 (Long-term improvements)
```

### Step 2: Generate Action Plan

Now let's create an executable action plan from the analysis:

```bash
cd ~/projects/my-node-app
```

### Step 2: Run the Deep Analysis

In Claude Code, use the deep analysis command:

```
/tk:analyze:deep
```

The command will:

1. **Phase 1**: Perform parallel scanning of your codebase
2. **Phase 2**: Delegate findings to specialized AI agents
3. **Phase 3**: Synthesize results into a comprehensive report
4. **Phase 4**: Export the report in multiple formats

### What Happens During Analysis

You'll see progress updates like:

```

### Manual Analysis and Fixes

1. **Run targeted analyses:**

   ```bash
   /tk:security:audit . --export-json
   /tk:orchestration:performance-scan .
   /tk:orchestration:test-coverage .
   ```

2. **Analyze reports individually:**

   ```bash
   /tk:analysis:analyze-report security-audit.json --quick-wins
   ```

3. **Apply specific fixes:**

   ```bash
   /tk:fix:security --priority=critical
   /tk:fix:duplicates --threshold=80
   /tk:generate:tests --coverage-target=60
   ```

For detailed manual workflow, see [Comprehensive Workflow Guide](../guides/COMPREHENSIVE-WORKFLOW.md).

Use the quick wins command:

```
/tk:fix:quick-wins --dry-run
```

The `--dry-run` flag shows what would be fixed without making changes:

```
üéØ Quick Wins Analysis

2. Run your test suite
3. Commit with: git commit -m "üéØ Apply quick wins from code analysis"
```

### Step 3: Verify the Improvements

After applying fixes, run a focused analysis to see the improvements:

```
/tk:analyze:deep --focus security,performance
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Commands Not Found

**Problem:** `/tk:` commands don't appear in Claude Code

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check installation
ls ~/.claude/commands/tk/

# If empty, reinstall:
cd ~/projects/claude-code-toolkit
./install.sh tk --force
```

### Analysis Takes Too Long

**Problem:** Deep analysis seems stuck

**Solution:**

- For large codebases, use focused analysis:

  ```
  /tk:analyze:deep --focus security --max-files 100
  ```

- Check Claude Code's activity indicator
- Try analyzing a smaller directory first

### Permission Errors

**Problem:** Can't write reports or apply fixes

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check permissions
ls -la ~/.claude/

# Fix permissions if needed
chmod -R 755 ~/.claude/
```

### Incorrect Analysis Results

**Problem:** Analysis seems to miss files or show wrong information

**Solution:**

- Ensure you're in the correct directory
- Check if files are ignored by `.gitignore`
- Try clearing Claude Code's context and rerunning

## Common Questions

### Q: Is it safe to run fixes automatically?

A: Yes! The toolkit has multiple safety measures:

- Always creates git commits before changes
- Runs in dry-run mode by default
- Validates changes don't break tests
- Supports rollback if needed

### Q: How long does the full workflow take?

A: Typically:

- Analysis: 30-60 seconds
- Action plan generation: 5-10 seconds
- Fix execution: 1-4 hours (depending on scope)
- Most quick wins complete in under 5 minutes each

### Q: Can I customize what gets fixed?

A: Absolutely! You can:

- Use `--focus=security` to fix only security issues
- Set `--max-effort=4h` to limit scope
- Run specific fix commands manually
- Edit the action plan before execution
