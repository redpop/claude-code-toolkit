## Prerequisites and Setup Verification

Before we begin, let's ensure you have everything needed to use the Claude Code Toolkit effectively.

### Required Software

1. **Claude Code (claude.ai/code)** - You need access to Claude Code
2. **Git** - For cloning the repository
3. **Bash shell** - For running the installation script (macOS/Linux have this by default)

### Verify Your Environment

Open your terminal and run these commands:

```bash
# Check if git is installed
git --version
# Expected output: git version 2.x.x

# Check your shell
echo $SHELL
# Expected output: /bin/bash or /bin/zsh (both work)

# Check if you have the Claude directory
ls ~/.claude/
# If this doesn't exist yet, that's okay - we'll create it during installation
```

> **💡 Tip:** If you're on Windows, use Git Bash or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for the best experience.

## Installing the Toolkit

Let's install the Claude Code Toolkit step by step.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the toolkit repository to your local machine:

```bash
# Navigate to where you keep your projects
cd ~/projects  # Or wherever you prefer

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-code-toolkit.git

# Enter the directory
cd claude-code-toolkit
```

### Step 2: Run the Installation Script

Now, let's install the toolkit with a custom prefix. The prefix helps you organize commands if you have multiple toolkit installations.

```bash
# Run the installer with a prefix (I'll use 'tk' for toolkit)
./install.sh tk
```

You'll see output like this:

```
🚀 Claude Code Toolkit Installer
================================

📦 Installing with prefix: tk

Creating directories...
✅ Created ~/.claude/commands/tk/
✅ Created ~/.claude/agents/

Copying commands...
✅ Installed 42 commands

Copying agents...
✅ Installed 7 agents

Installation complete! 🎉

Available commands:
  /tk:analyze:deep - Deep code analysis using hybrid Task Tool + Sub-Agent approach
  /tk:analyze:report - Analyze code quality reports with ROI prioritization
  /tk:fix:quick-wins - Automatically implement high-value, low-effort fixes
  ... (more commands listed)
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation

In Claude Code, test that your commands are available:

1. Open Claude Code (claude.ai/code)
2. Type `/tk:` and you should see autocomplete suggestions
3. Try a simple command like `/tk:help` to see available commands

> **🔧 Troubleshooting:** If commands don't appear, try refreshing Claude Code or check that the installation path `~/.claude/commands/tk/` contains the command files.

## Running Your First Analysis

Let's analyze a sample project to see the toolkit in action. We'll use a hypothetical Node.js project, but the toolkit works with any language.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Project

Navigate to a project you want to analyze:

```bash
cd ~/projects/my-node-app
```

### Step 2: Run the Deep Analysis

In Claude Code, use the deep analysis command:

```
/tk:analyze:deep
```

The command will:
1. **Phase 1**: Perform parallel scanning of your codebase
2. **Phase 2**: Delegate findings to specialized AI agents
3. **Phase 3**: Synthesize results into a comprehensive report
4. **Phase 4**: Export the report in multiple formats

### What Happens During Analysis

You'll see progress updates like:

```

## Using the Report Analyzer

The report analyzer helps you make sense of analysis reports and plan your improvements.

### Step 1: Analyze Your Report

After running the deep analysis, use the report analyzer:

```
/tk:analyze:report ~/.claude/reports/deep-analysis-2024-01-15-143022.md
```

### Step 2: Understanding the Analysis

The report analyzer provides:

```markdown
# Report Analysis Summary

```

## Finding and Fixing Quick Wins

Quick wins are the best place to start improving your codebase. They offer high value with minimal effort.

### Step 1: Identify Quick Wins

Use the quick wins command:

```
/tk:fix:quick-wins --dry-run
```

The `--dry-run` flag shows what would be fixed without making changes:

```
🎯 Quick Wins Analysis
=====================

Found 12 quick wins:

1. **Add missing database indexes**
   - Tables: users, posts, comments
   - Performance gain: ~70% for common queries
   - Auto-fix available: YES

2. **Enable gzip compression**
   - File: server.js
   - Bandwidth savings: ~60%
   - Auto-fix available: YES

3. **Fix ESLint errors**
   - Files: 23 files with auto-fixable issues
   - Code quality improvement
   - Auto-fix available: YES

4. **Add security headers**
   - Missing: X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
   - Security score improvement: +5 points
   - Auto-fix available: YES

Total estimated time: 45 minutes
Automated fixes available: 10/12
```

### Step 2: Apply Quick Wins

When you're ready, apply the fixes:

```
/tk:fix:quick-wins --apply
```

The command will:
1. Create backups of modified files
2. Apply automated fixes
3. Run tests (if available)
4. Generate a summary report

Example output:

```
✅ Quick Wins Applied
====================

Files modified: 28
Tests status: All passing ✓
Backup created: ~/.claude/backups/quickwins-2024-01-15-150234/

Changes summary:
- Added 3 database indexes
- Enabled compression middleware
- Fixed 127 ESLint issues
- Added 5 security headers

Next steps:
1. Review changes in your git diff
2. Run your test suite
3. Commit with: git commit -m "🎯 Apply quick wins from code analysis"
```

### Step 3: Verify the Improvements

After applying fixes, run a focused analysis to see the improvements:

```
/tk:analyze:deep --focus security,performance
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Commands Not Found

**Problem:** `/tk:` commands don't appear in Claude Code

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check installation
ls ~/.claude/commands/tk/

# If empty, reinstall:
cd ~/projects/claude-code-toolkit
./install.sh tk --force
```

### Analysis Takes Too Long

**Problem:** Deep analysis seems stuck

**Solution:**
- For large codebases, use focused analysis:
  ```
  /tk:analyze:deep --focus security --max-files 100
  ```
- Check Claude Code's activity indicator
- Try analyzing a smaller directory first

### Permission Errors

**Problem:** Can't write reports or apply fixes

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check permissions
ls -la ~/.claude/

# Fix permissions if needed
chmod -R 755 ~/.claude/
```

### Incorrect Analysis Results

**Problem:** Analysis seems to miss files or show wrong information

**Solution:**
- Ensure you're in the correct directory
- Check if files are ignored by `.gitignore`
- Try clearing Claude Code's context and rerunning
