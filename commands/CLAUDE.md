# CLAUDE.md - Commands Directory

This file provides context for Claude Code when working with commands in this directory.

## Command Structure

Commands are organized hierarchically by category, with each command being a markdown file containing instructions for Claude Code.

## Command Naming Convention

- Commands are organized in subdirectories under `commands/`
- Directory structure determines command namespace: `commands/category/command.md` â†’ `/prefix:category:command`
- Categories follow clear purposes: `scan`, `fix`, `gen`, `flow`, `auto`, `sec`, `git`, `meta`
- Use short, action-oriented names (e.g., `deep` not `analyze-deep`)
- Maximum 2 words per command name
- Use verbs for clarity

## Command Format

Each command is a Markdown file containing:

1. **Frontmatter** (YAML format) with Claude Code-compatible fields:

   ```yaml
   ---
   description: Brief command description
   argument-hint: Expected arguments for auto-completion
   mcp-enhanced: Optional MCP tools that enhance this command
   ---
   ```

2. **Command Content Structure**:
   - Command description and purpose
   - Usage instructions with examples
   - Detailed workflow steps
   - Best practices and guidelines
   - Examples of expected output

## Key Patterns

### Explicit Task Tool Syntax

All multi-agent commands use explicit Task tool invocation:

```markdown
Use Task tool with subagent_type="general-purpose":
"Your detailed prompt here with specific instructions and expected output format."
```

This pattern ensures:

- Clear agent invocation
- Proper context isolation
- Predictable behavior
- Better error handling

### Command Chaining Architecture

Commands can be chained with automatic data flow:

```bash
/prefix:meta:chain "scan:deep ." -> "fix:quick-wins {output}" -> "scan:quality . --compare"
```

Features:

- `{output}` - Previous command's output
- `{outputs}` - All previous outputs array
- `->` - Sequential execution
- `[cmd1, cmd2]` - Parallel execution
- `?>` - Conditional execution
- `!>` - Error fallback

### Hybrid Architecture

The hybrid architecture combines parallel processing with specialized expertise:

**Phase 1: Parallel Scanning**

- Uses Task Tool for rapid parallel execution
- Multiple scanner agents work simultaneously
- Optimized for speed and broad coverage
- Produces structured JSON output

**Phase 2: Expert Analysis**

- Results from Phase 1 are intelligently delegated
- Specialized Sub-Agents provide deep analysis
- Each agent has domain-specific expertise
- Agents work in isolated contexts

**Phase 3: Synthesis**

- Results from all agents are combined
- Final report integrates all perspectives
- Provides actionable recommendations

### Smart Problem Routing

The `/flow:smart` command analyzes problems and routes to appropriate specialists:

1. Problem analysis and categorization
2. Multi-agent task distribution
3. Parallel execution where possible
4. Consolidated results with action plan

## Command Design Principles

- **Maximum 200-300 lines**: Keep commands focused and maintainable
- **Clear phase structure**: Organize complex workflows into phases
- **Explicit Task syntax**: Use clear agent invocation patterns
- **Focused functionality**: Each command does one thing well
- **Reusable patterns**: Build on established patterns

## Adding New Commands

1. Create appropriate category directory under `commands/` if needed
2. Create `.md` file with descriptive command name
3. Add frontmatter with at minimum a `description` field
4. Write command as detailed Markdown prompt with clear instructions
5. Include usage examples and expected behaviors
6. Run `./scripts/update-readme.sh` to update README documentation

## MCP Enhancement

Commands can leverage MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools when available:

```yaml
---
mcp-enhanced: mcp__semgrep__security_check, mcp__github__create_pr
---
```

Implementation should:

1. Check for MCP tool availability
2. Use enhanced approach if available
3. Fall back to traditional methods if not
4. Report which method was used

## Testing Commands

After adding a command:

1. Install locally: `~/.claude/commands/test/`
2. Verify command appears with correct namespace
3. Test command execution in a sample project
4. Document in user guide if significant

## Important Notes

- The `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder receives user input after command invocation
- Commands should be self-contained with all necessary context
- Avoid creating example or demo commands
- Focus on practical, reusable tools
- Commands work best when they follow established patterns
