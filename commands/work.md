# Work - Smart Workflow Coordination

Intelligent workflow command that automatically routes problems to the right experts and coordinates multi-agent solutions. Zero configuration, maximum expertise.

## Help Check

If "$ARGUMENTS" contains "--help" or "-h":
Display command help and exit.

## Smart Workflow Types

**Automatically coordinates specialized agents and exports results with timestamped reports.**

### Available Workflow Types

- `smart` - Intelligent problem routing to appropriate specialists (default)
- `review` - Multi-perspective code review with expert analysis
- `refactor` - Intelligent refactoring with impact analysis and safety
- `incident` - Rapid incident response for production issues
- `debug` - Intensive debugging mode for complex problems
- `fix` - Problem resolution with expert coordination
- `assess` - Comprehensive assessment with multiple perspectives
- `plan` - Strategic planning with architectural guidance
- `optimize` - Performance and quality optimization workflow

## Usage

```bash
# Smart defaults - intelligent problem routing
/prefix:work "Authentication failing after user login"

# Specific workflow types
/prefix:work smart "API performance issues"     # Auto-route to performance experts
/prefix:work review src/auth/                   # Multi-expert code review
/prefix:work refactor legacy-parser.js         # Safe refactoring with impact analysis
/prefix:work incident "Database connection lost" # Rapid incident response

# Specialized workflows
/prefix:work debug --verbose                    # Intensive debugging mode
/prefix:work optimize backend/                  # Performance optimization
/prefix:work plan "Microservices migration"    # Strategic planning
```

## Execution

### Smart Routing Logic

**Parsing arguments**: "$ARGUMENTS"

**Step 1: Determine workflow type and target**

```bash
# Parse arguments
args=($ARGUMENTS)
workflow_type="smart"    # default to intelligent routing
target_or_description="${args[*]}"

# Check if first arg is a workflow type
workflow_types=("smart" "review" "refactor" "incident" "debug" "fix" "assess" "plan" "optimize")
if [[ " ${workflow_types[@]} " =~ " ${args[0]} " ]]; then
    workflow_type=${args[0]}
    target_or_description="${args[@]:1}"
fi
```

**Step 2: Route to appropriate workflow strategy**

Based on workflow_type, execute the optimal approach:

"Coordinate comprehensive code review of '$target_or_description' using multiple specialized perspectives. Execute parallel analysis: code quality (design patterns, SOLID principles, complexity), security review (vulnerabilities, authentication, input validation), architecture assessment (coupling, scalability, API design), performance analysis (bottlenecks, algorithms, memory usage). Synthesize findings with prioritized recommendations and consensus opinion."

### Intelligent Refactoring Workflow

**Target**: Safe refactoring analysis for `$target_or_description`
**Export**: Auto-generates `work-refactor-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json` + `.md`

Use Task tool with subagent_type="refactoring-expert":
"Execute intelligent refactoring workflow for '$target_or_description'. Phase 1: Analyze code structure and identify refactoring opportunities (code smells, duplication, coupling issues). Phase 2: Assess impact radius (dependencies, tests, external contracts). Phase 3: Generate step-by-step refactoring plan with safety levels (conservative/balanced/aggressive) and risk assessment. Provide ROI-prioritized recommendations."

### Rapid Incident Response

**Target**: Production incident handling for `$target_or_description`
**Export**: Auto-generates `work-incident-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json` + `.md`

Use Task tool with subagent_type="debugging-specialist":
"INCIDENT RESPONSE MODE: Handle production incident '$target_or_description'. Phase 1: Immediate assessment (severity classification, impact analysis, initial diagnostics). Phase 2: Root cause analysis (system diagnostics, code analysis, infrastructure review). Phase 3: Mitigation strategy (immediate fixes, rollback options, monitoring). Phase 4: Resolution plan with audit trail. Coordinate multiple agents for rapid response."

### Intensive Debugging Mode

**Target**: Deep debugging analysis for `$target_or_description`
**Export**: Auto-generates `work-debug-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json` + `.md`

Use Task tool with subagent_type="debugging-specialist":
"INTENSIVE DEBUG MODE ACTIVATED: Ultra-intensive reasoning for '$target_or_description'. Analyze current context, error patterns, implementation state, and failed approaches. Apply systematic debugging: reproduce issue, isolate components, trace execution paths, analyze data flows, test hypotheses.

## Agent Coordination Patterns

### Sequential Coordination

For complex problems requiring step-by-step analysis:

1. Initial analysis agent
2. Specialized deep-dive agent  
3. Solution synthesis agent

### Parallel Coordination

For comprehensive reviews requiring multiple perspectives:

1. Launch multiple specialists simultaneously
2. Collect diverse expert opinions
3. Synthesize consensus recommendations

### Iterative Coordination

For problems requiring refinement:

1. Initial solution attempt
2. Validation and feedback
3. Refinement and re-evaluation
