# Command Finder - Discover the Right Tool for Your Task

This intelligent command helps you find the most suitable Claude Code command for your specific task by analyzing all available commands (both globally installed and project-local).

## Usage

```bash
/prefix:meta:find-cmd "optimize shell scripts"        # Find commands for shell optimization
/prefix:meta:find-cmd "refactor code" --all          # Show all matching commands
/prefix:meta:find-cmd "test coverage" --local-only   # Only search local commands
/prefix:meta:find-cmd "security audit" --global-only # Only search global commands
```

## How It Works

1. **Command Discovery**
   - Scans `~/.claude/commands/` for globally installed commands
   - Scans `.claude/commands/` in current project for local commands
   - Reads command metadata and descriptions

2. **Intelligent Matching**
   - Analyzes your task description
   - Matches keywords with command capabilities
   - Considers synonyms and related terms
   - Ranks by relevance score

3. **Smart Recommendations**
   - Shows best match with explanation
   - Lists alternative commands
   - Provides usage examples
   - Indicates command source (global/local)

## Workflow

$ARGUMENTS

Let me analyze your request and find the best commands for this task:

### Step 1: Discovering Available Commands and Agents

First, I'll scan for all available commands and agents in your environment:

```bash
# Check global commands
echo "üåç Scanning global commands in ~/.claude/commands/"
find ~/.claude/commands -name "*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -20

# Check local project commands  
echo "üìÅ Scanning local commands in .claude/commands/"
find .claude/commands -name "*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -20

# Check global agents
echo "ü§ñ Scanning global agents in ~/.claude/agents/"
find ~/.claude/agents -name "*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -20

# Check local project agents
echo "üìÅ Scanning local agents in .claude/agents/"
find .claude/agents -name "*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -20
```

### Step 2: Analyzing Your Request

Now I'll analyze your task description to understand:
- Primary action needed (analyze, fix, generate, etc.)
- Target area (code, security, performance, etc.)
- Specific requirements or constraints

### Step 3: Analyzing Found Commands

Based on the commands and agents discovered in Step 1, I'll now match them to your request.

**Your task**: $ARGUMENTS

Let me check which commands from your toolkit best match this task:

```bash
# Quick analysis of found commands
echo "üìä Analyzing available commands for your task..."
```

### Step 4: Command Recommendations

## üéØ Recommended Commands for Your Task

Based on your request and available commands, here are your best options:

### Primary Recommendations:

**For refactoring tasks:**
- `/prefix:flow:refactor <path>` - Intelligent refactoring with impact analysis
- `/prefix:scan:refactor <path>` - Analyze refactoring opportunities
- `/prefix:scan:deep <path>` - Deep code analysis before refactoring

**For TYPO3 extensions:**
- Check local `.claude/commands/` for TYPO3-specific commands
- Use `/prefix:flow:smart` for intelligent routing to specialists

**For code analysis:**
- `/prefix:scan:quality <path>` - Code quality metrics
- `/prefix:scan:deps <path>` - Dependency analysis
- `/prefix:flow:review <path>` - Multi-perspective code review

### How to Use:

Choose the command that best fits your needs and run it with your target:
```bash
# Example for refactoring
/prefix:flow:refactor typo3/packages/headless-api-auth/

# Example for analysis first
/prefix:scan:deep typo3/packages/headless-api-auth/ --export-json
```

## ü§ñ Available Specialized Agents

If you prefer working with specialized agents, use `/prefix:flow:smart` to route to:
- **refactoring-expert** - Code refactoring specialist
- **code-architect** - Architecture analysis
- **test-engineer** - Test coverage improvement

## üí° Recommended Workflow

For refactoring a TYPO3 extension, I recommend this sequence:

1. **Analyze first**: `/prefix:scan:deep typo3/packages/headless-api-auth/`
2. **Review refactoring opportunities**: `/prefix:scan:refactor typo3/packages/headless-api-auth/`
3. **Execute refactoring**: `/prefix:flow:refactor typo3/packages/headless-api-auth/`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

This is a recommendation list. Choose the command you want to run - nothing will be executed automatically.

## Need Different Commands?

If none of these fit your needs:
- Use `/prefix:meta:create` to create a custom command
- Use `/prefix:flow:smart` for intelligent problem routing
- Check local project commands with `ls .claude/commands/`

## üí° Related Commands You Might Need

Based on your task, you might also want to consider:
- `[RELATED_COMMAND_1]`: [Brief description]
- `[RELATED_COMMAND_2]`: [Brief description]

## üîÑ Command Chaining Suggestion

For comprehensive results, consider chaining commands:
```bash
/prefix:meta:chain "[COMMAND_1]" -> "[COMMAND_2]" -> "[COMMAND_3]"
```

## Command Details

To learn more about any command, you can:
1. Read the command file directly
2. Run the command with `--help` if supported
3. Check the documentation in `/docs/`

## Didn't Find What You Need?

If no existing command matches your needs:
1. Use `/prefix:meta:create` to create any command, agent, or workflow you need
2. Use `/prefix:flow:smart` for intelligent problem routing  
3. Combine multiple commands with `/prefix:meta:chain`

Remember: Commands are constantly being added and improved. Run this finder regularly to discover new tools!
