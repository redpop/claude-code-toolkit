# Quick Code Analysis

Lightning-fast code analysis using parallel agents, perfect for pre-commit checks and rapid feedback. Gets you 80% of insights in 20% of the time.

## Help Check

If "$ARGUMENTS" contains "--help" or "-h":

Display this command's documentation:

- **Description**: Quick parallel code analysis for rapid feedback (30 seconds)
- **Usage**: <directory> [--focus=area] [--export-json]
- **Options**: See options section below
- **Examples**: See usage examples section below

Then exit without executing the main command.

## How It Works

All 10 agents run simultaneously, each scanning for specific issues. Results are then consolidated and prioritized.

**Expected Performance**: 5-8 seconds total (vs 50-60 seconds sequential)

## Execution

**Target**: $ARGUMENTS

### Deploying 10 Parallel Agents

Use Task tool with subagent_type="general-purpose" for ALL agents simultaneously:

1. **Complexity Agent**
   "Find functions with cyclomatic complexity >10, nesting >4 levels, length >50 lines in $ARGUMENTS. Return top 10 as JSON."

2. **Duplication Agent**  
   "Find duplicate code blocks >10 lines in $ARGUMENTS. Use pattern matching to identify copy-paste code. Return JSON with locations."

3. **Style Agent**
   "Check style violations in $ARGUMENTS: naming conventions, formatting, import order. Return most frequent issues as JSON."

4. **Documentation Agent**
   "Find missing docs in $ARGUMENTS: undocumented functions/classes, outdated comments, incomplete READMEs. Return as JSON."

5. **Dead Code Agent**
   "Identify unused code in $ARGUMENTS: unused functions, variables, imports, unreachable code. Return locations as JSON."

6. **Type Safety Agent**
   "Check type issues in $ARGUMENTS: missing annotations, any-types, type mismatches. Return critical type issues as JSON."

7. **Security Agent**
   "Quick security scan of $ARGUMENTS: hardcoded secrets, unsafe functions, injection risks. Return top 5 security issues as JSON."

8. **Performance Agent**
   "Find performance issues in $ARGUMENTS: O(nÂ²) algorithms, unnecessary loops, memory leaks. Return bottlenecks as JSON."

9. **Test Quality Agent**
   "Assess test quality in $ARGUMENTS: coverage gaps, missing edge cases, flaky patterns. Return test issues as JSON."

10. **Dependency Agent**
    "Analyze dependencies in $ARGUMENTS: circular deps, outdated packages, license issues. Return dependency problems as JSON."

### Result Synthesis

After all agents complete, consolidate findings:

## Parallel Analysis Report

### Executive Summary

- **Scan Duration**: [X seconds]
- **Total Issues**: [Count by severity]
- **Health Score**: [0-100]

### Critical Issues (Immediate Action)

[Security vulnerabilities, memory leaks, broken functionality]

### High Priority (This Sprint)

[Performance problems, major code smells, missing tests]

### Medium Priority (Next Sprint)

[Code complexity, documentation gaps, style issues]

### Quick Wins (< 1 hour each)

[Easy fixes with high impact]

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

Based on the quick analysis, I recommend:

### 1. **Immediate Actions** (5 min)

```bash
# Fix the quick wins identified
/prefix:fix:quick-wins {export-file}
```

### 2. **Deep Analysis** (If critical issues found)

```bash
# Run comprehensive scan for detailed insights
/prefix:scan:deep . --focus={critical-area}

# Or generate full action plan
/prefix:scan:report {export-file} --generate-action-plan
```

### 3. **Continuous Monitoring**

```bash
# Set up pre-commit hook with this command
/prefix:meta:install-hook pre-commit "scan:quick"

# Or add to CI pipeline
/prefix:meta:pipelines quick-quality
```

## ðŸ“¤ Export Information

- **Results saved to**: `{export-file}`
- **Scan time**: ~30 seconds
- **Coverage**: 80% of common issues

ðŸ’¡ **Pro tip**: Use this for rapid feedback during development. For comprehensive analysis, use `/prefix:scan:deep`.

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Quick health check
/prefix:scan:quick src/

# Focused analysis
/prefix:scan:quick src/api --focus=security

# Export for automation
/prefix:scan:quick . --export-json=health-check.json
```

## Integration Points

This command is ideal for:

- Pre-commit hooks (fast enough for real-time)
- CI/CD pipeline quality gates
- Daily health checks
- Quick project assessments

## Key Benefits

- **10x Faster**: Parallel execution vs sequential
- **Comprehensive**: Covers all major quality aspects
- **Actionable**: Prioritized findings with next steps
- **Lightweight**: No external dependencies
